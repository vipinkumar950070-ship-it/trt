    <h2>General Conditions</h2>
    <p>These terms and conditions, our privacy policy and our cookie policy apply to your use of Primestreams, regardless of how you access it and whether or not you pay a fee. You can find our privacy policy <a href="#">here</a> and our cookie policy <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

    <p>When you access Primestreams through an application, for example on a mobile phone or smart TV, or on a device that you plug into your TV to enable it to connect to the Internet such as an HDMI dongle, separate terms of use may apply to the use of that application and/or device. Separate terms may also apply to certain Premium Content that you can access for an additional fee. You must ensure that you have read and accepted the terms of use for the application, the terms that were provided to you with your device and/or those of the other channels that were provided to you as part of the registration process.</p>

    <p>By browsing www.primestreams.com (hereinafter our "Website"), accessing, registering or using Primestreams (hereinafter "Use"), you accept and acknowledge being bound by these Terms and Conditions which constitute a legal "contract" between us and you, the user of our Website or any service we provide (including Primestreams) ("you"), on the date you start using it. Please take the time to read and understand them. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, you must not use our Website or Primestreams (as applicable).</p>

    <h2>What is Primestreams?</h2>
    <p>Primestreams offers a paid subscription service called Primestreams Premium. Primestreams Premium gives you access to exceptional entertainment with a selection of exclusive live and on-demand channels.</p>

    <h2>How much does Primestreams cost and how is payment collected?</h2>
    <p>The fees payable by you for Primestreams Premium (“Primestreams Service”) are set out on our Website, updated regularly, and depend on your subscription (monthly or annual).</p>

    <p>Our rates include VAT and any other applicable sales taxes.</p>

    <p>You can find details of your current subscription, including available channels, as well as your current subscription fees and the end date of any potential free trial period, by visiting our website and logging into the 'Account' section.</p>

    <h2>How is payment for a Primestreams service collected and when can you access this service?</h2>
    <h3>Functioning</h3>
    <p>Unless otherwise stated as part of the registration process, availability and Premium Access will be provided to you subject to your adherence to these general conditions.</p>

    <h3>Monthly subscription fees</h3>
    <p>Subscription fees are payable from the first month of subscription, then every month until cancelled.</p>

    <p>You will have access to Primestreams Premium every month, subject to having paid the monthly subscription fee in advance for each month.</p>

    <h3>Annual subscription fee</h3>
    <p>Subscription fees are payable from the first year of subscription, then annually until cancelled.</p>

    <p>You will have access to Primestreams Premium every year, subject to having paid the annual subscription fee in advance for each year.</p>

    <h3>Your payment card will generally be charged on the day you sign up, unless otherwise stated (for example, if you sign up for Primestreams Premium under a free trial offer, payment is generally taken at the end of the free trial period), and you will have immediate access to your Primestreams service.</h3>
    <p>If you sign up for Primestreams Premium under a free trial offer, a payment will be authorized by your bank (which may involve the payment and reimbursement of a small verification fee). Please note that this may affect your available balance or credit limit.</p>

    <h3>When you subscribe to a Primestreams service on the Website, the fee will be processed by a third-party payment service provider. The monthly subscription fee will usually be collected on the same date each month, but this may sometimes vary. For payments through an app such as PayPal, check the terms of the relevant payment service provider.</h3>

    <p>If the relevant payment service provider cannot process the payment, you will not be able to use/access the part of the Primestreams Service(s) for which the payment failed.</p>

<h2>Changes to our prices for the Primestreams service</h2>
    <p>We may increase our fees at any time. If we do, we will notify you by contacting you as set out in the <strong>How do we contact you?</strong> section or by updating the relevant pages on the Website. If there is a material change to the subscription fees, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you at least thirty days in advance. Reasons for increasing the subscription fees may include the addition of subscription content or other costs associated with providing Primestreams Premium. As we provide these services to you on an ongoing basis, there may be other reasons for increasing the subscription fees that we cannot yet predict. Any increase in the subscription fees will not apply to the current period (month or year) of your subscription. If you do not agree to the increase in the rate, you may cancel your subscription before the start of the next applicable period. For more information on how to do this, please refer to <a href="#">Canceling your Primestreams Premium subscription</a>.</p>

    <p>We make every effort to ensure that the rates we quote to you are correct. If, despite this, the rates quoted are clearly incorrect, or if such rates could reasonably be expected to be incorrect, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your subscription, subject to refunding any amounts unduly paid.</p>

    <p>We may offer a promotion or special offer at any time. Specific terms and conditions may apply to that promotion or special offer. In this case, we will display them with the details of the promotion or special offer. These terms and conditions will continue to apply to the promotion or special offer, in addition to the specific terms and conditions (if any).</p>

    <h2>Free trial period</h2>
    <p>Your Primestreams Premium subscription may start with a free trial. The free trial period is what was specified to you during registration.</p>

    <p>Eligibility for any free trial period is determined by us and at our sole discretion. We may also limit eligibility to prevent abuse of the free trial.</p>

    <p>We will charge your monthly or annual membership fee to your payment method at the end of the free trial period, unless you cancel your membership before the end of the free trial period. To view your current membership fee and the end date of any free trial period:</p>

    <h2>Changes to the Primestreams Service and these Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>By its nature, the content of Primestreams changes regularly. At any time, we may add new channels, new programs and/or remove others. We hope that you will like these changes but we cannot promise that this will always be the case. We invite you to visit the website to learn more about what is available.</p>

    <p>From time to time we may change the way we provide access to Primestreams, which may mean that we need to make changes to these terms and conditions. We are not always able to notify you in advance. Therefore, we advise you to regularly check our website, where any updates to these terms and conditions are published. We consider that you have accepted these updates as soon as you continue to use Primestreams or our website.</p>

    <p>For Primestreams Premium subscribers, we will not make changes that materially disadvantage you during the month (or year, as applicable) for which you have already paid a subscription fee, unless this is outside our control, for example on instructions from our content providers, or for legal or regulatory reasons.</p>

    <p>As we provide the Primestreams Services to you on an ongoing basis, there may be other reasons to change the Service or these Terms and Conditions that we cannot yet foresee. You acknowledge that we are bound by certain terms and conditions issued by our content providers in connection with the distribution of any Primestreams Services and that these may change from time to time. This may mean that we need to change the Service we provide to you. We will notify you of any material changes to access to the Primestreams Services where possible or of any material changes to our Terms and Conditions. We will do our best to notify you with at least thirty days' notice using the method described in the <strong>How do we contact you?</strong> section. If you do not agree with the changes we have made, you may cancel your subscription as described above in the <a href="#">Cancelling your Primestreams Premium subscription</a> section. We consider that you have accepted the changes made as soon as you continue to use Primestreams Premium after being informed of these changes.</p>

    <h2>How do we contact you?</h2>
    <p>We will generally contact you electronically, using the email address you provided during registration or through the Website. We may send you emails, for example, to inform you about changes to Primestreams, so please ensure that you have provided accurate contact information and be sure to notify us of any changes to your email address.

    <p>If you subscribe to a Primestreams service, you are authorized to access only the content and services for which you have paid the appropriate fees.</p>

    <p>You acknowledge that all content to which we provide you with access, whether on Primestreams (and this for any Primestreams service), the Website or any application, including television shows, advertising, our brand or the brands of our content providers (the "Content") is our property or that we have the rights to such Content, and that your rights in such Content will be limited to accessing such Content, on a broadcast basis only, for personal, non-commercial use, and in accordance with these terms and conditions.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of actions you are not allowed to do (or that you cannot allow anyone else using your Primestreams access to do):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display the Content publicly, whether or not you charge an audience to view it;</li>

    <p>You may only access the Content and the Primestreams service in the French territory and in the following overseas territories: Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Reunion Island, Mayotte, Guyana, provided that, when accessing and using the content, you undertake, in accordance with this section, to comply with all laws and regulations in force in the country from which you access the content. You must also follow our reasonable instructions and requirements regarding your use of Primestreams and its content.</p>


    <h1>What do you need to access Primestreams?</h1>
    <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you have and maintain all necessary hardware and software to access Primestreams via your chosen means. You will also need access to the Internet with a broadband connection or a 3G or 4G mobile network to stream content. We recommend a minimum speed of 1 Mbps to stream content at broadband speeds and remember that streaming speeds will depend on the load on your home network and the number of users using the broadband connection at the same time. To stream content over a 3G or 4G mobile network, you will need a connection speed of at least 1 Mbps, which can increase to approximately 2.5 Mbps depending on the type of content you are accessing and the device you are using.</p>
    
    <p>You will be responsible for paying any charges from your broadband and/or mobile network provider. We remind you that streaming audiovisual content can use a lot of data. You should therefore check that your data plan is suitable for your use of Primestreams on a mobile network.</p>
    
    <p>Streaming software used to deliver content may require third-party software and be subject to third-party licenses.</p>
    
    <p>Primestreams uses various caching and data delivery technologies to facilitate media delivery and improve performance for end users. By using the Service, you hereby grant Primestreams and the Primestreams Service the right to use the processing, memory, and bandwidth capabilities of your computer or other applicable device for the limited purpose of facilitating the transmission of content and other data or functionality to you and other users of the Site, and to facilitate the operation of the network on which the Primestreams Service runs. You are solely responsible for any telecommunications or connectivity charges resulting from your use of Primestreams. If your use of Primestreams depends on the use of processor and bandwidth owned or controlled by a third party, you acknowledge and agree that your license to use Primestreams is subject to obtaining the consent of the applicable third party for such use. You represent and warrant that by accepting these Terms, you have obtained such consent.</p>

    <h1>What devices can you access Primestreams on?</h1>
    <p>We are continually reviewing the technology used to provide Primestreams and its content, which may mean that we stop supporting certain devices and/or operating systems. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a compatible device and as required to access Primestreams.</p>
    
    <p>Additionally, device manufacturers make updates to their devices that may not always be compatible with Primestreams. We have no control over these. For security reasons, such as when certain operating systems have been removed or altered or a platform requires a device limitation for security reasons beyond our control, some content may not be accessible to protect our licensors.</p>
    
    <p>You can only register one compatible device to your account at a time.</p>
    
    <p>Primestreams Premium users are limited to one content stream, per account, at a time.</p>

    <h1>Your password</h1>
    <p>You are responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password. You can reset your password at any time by clicking on the “Forgotten Password” link in the login section of the Website or App. If you become aware that someone else knows your password, you must notify us and change it immediately. Please remember that your use of Primestreams is strictly personal.</p>

    <h1>Closing your account</h1>
    <p>If you wish to close your Primestreams account and permanently delete your information, please contact us by email at support-fr@primestreams.com.</p>

    <h1>In what cases can you terminate my access to Primestreams Premium?</h1>
    <p>At any time and immediately, we may terminate your access to the Primestreams Service, upon notice and without refund of applicable fees (for example, the current month's subscription fees) if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We reasonably believe that you have committed fraudulent activity against us or a third party through your use of a Primestreams Service or Content;</li>
        <li>The subscription fee (or any part thereof) is still unpaid for more than three days following our notification. We may suspend your access to Primestreams Premium during the period in which the subscription fee is unpaid or fails, until the subscription fee is paid.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At any time and immediately, we may also terminate your access to the Primestreams service, with notice, if we are obliged to do so for technical or operational reasons beyond our control.</p>

    <h1>Waiver of your 14-day right of withdrawal</h1>
    <p>The Service offers dematerialized content not provided on physical media, the delivery of which to the subscriber is carried out immediately.</p>
    <p>Consequently, in application of article L221-28 of the Consumer Code, the Service is not eligible for the 14-day right of withdrawal. The waiver of the right of withdrawal and the acceptance of the immediate execution of the Service are subject to information and acceptance by the subscriber when the latter subscribes to the Service.</p>
    <p>In application of article L221-28 of the Consumer Code, the waiver of the right of withdrawal and the acceptance of the immediate execution of the Service are subject to confirmation in the registration confirmation email sent to the subscriber.</p>
